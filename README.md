# Blocky 3D Animal
<br>
<br> For my project, I decided to work on BMO from Adventure Time!
<br> The reasoning for this is because I have recently been rewatching the show and greatly enjoying it, so I thought it would be cool to have something made from the show.
<br> I originally wanted to have a theme similar to my last "Invincible" project, however, I could not come up with anything.
<br>
<br>
<br> This took a lot longer than expected and due to an overloading in coursework/ outside of school responsibilities, I ended up submitting a bit later than I would have liked and I apologize for that.
<br>
<br> BMO is also short for "Be MOre" - from BMO's creator.
<br> The background is just from deviantart:

<br>
<br> I have a performance checker/fps counter right below the Canvas.
<br> I also have a reset button that resets all rotations, transformations, animations,... etc.
<br> I have 2 main animations.
<br> 1. The BMO Idle Animation that can be used by pressing the ON/OFF button on screen. This is just BMO's arms and legs moving in a regular idle animation.
<br> 2. If the user does a shift-mouseclick, the second animation activates. This is BMO's eyes moving around as well as (a little harder to see) all of BMO's buttons moving as if they are being clicked. BMO is a game console after-all, so it would make sense for their buttons to be able to move. To see this better, you may have to rotate BMO to be looking at it from the side to properly see the buttons going up and down.
<br>
<br> I also was able to have a mouse-click-to-drag type of system where you can just click and drag the mouse on the canvas to move around BMO. I thought this would be difficult at first, but another student on the discord mentioned an easy way to do this.
<br>
<br> Now onto the sliders...
<br> I have 2 sliders for camera rotation, one for left to right and one for up and down.
<br> I also have a slider that move's BMO's left arm, left hand, right arm, right hand, left leg, left foot, right leg, and right foot.
<br> I should mention that the feet are also the third joint. The entire leg is basically consisted of 3 parts. 2 main leg parts and the foot at the bottom.
<br> I know my animations/joint movements are nothing crazy but I am happy with what I was able to accomplish and learn from this!
