<br> painting Assignment for Introduction to Computer Graphics.
<br>
<br> For the picture, I chose to draw Omni-Man from the Invincible series (and comics).
<br> After I drew a sketch on some graph paper, I added it to my site then drew the actual picture using just triangles.
<br> It was here that I decided to make my page themed around Invincible/Omni-Man

## Changes I made:
<br> I added a new header/title to the top of the page: Viltrum Empire Paint Program (Context: Omni-Man is a Viltrum.)
<br> I also added a border around the Canvas and the Reference image.
<br> I added the charactera Green-Ghost and Red-Rush to the corresponding color buttons since I thought that would fit nicely. The splatter on the "Load Viltrumite" button is also inspired by the splatter from the Invincible title cards.
<br> My favorite part, I also added a little Omni-Man audio clip from the show when the "Load Viltrumite" button is pressed :D
<br>
